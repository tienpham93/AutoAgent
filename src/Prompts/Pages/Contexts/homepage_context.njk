🏠 HOMEPAGE CONTEXT (DYNAMIC IDENTIFICATION)
===============
📋 DESCRIPTION: The Agoda landing page. Use the YAML snapshot to find the current `ref` ID based on the following stable attributes.
===============
🗺️ PAGE COMPONENTS:
    🧩 SEARCH HOTEL COMPONENTS:
        1️⃣. Search Input field:
            🔑 Keywords: destination input, property name, search bar
            🆔 Identification: Look for a `combobox` with the name `"Enter a destination or property"`.
            👨‍🏫 Action: `playwright-cli fill <found_ref> "City Name"`
        2️⃣. Check-in/Check-out Buttons:
            🔑 Keywords: check in box, date selector
            🆔 Identification: Look for `button` elements whose names start with `"Check-in"` or `"Check-out"`. 
            👨‍🏫 Note: These labels change dynamically (e.g., "Check-in 1 Mar 2026"). Use partial string matching in the YAML.
        3️⃣. Date Picker Dialog:
            🔑 Keywords: calendar, date picker dialog
            🆔 Identification: Look for a `dialog` with the name `"Check Out Date Picker"`.
            🆔 Grid/Dates: Inside the dialog, find the `grid`. Target dates are `button` or `gridcell` elements with the name format `"Day Month Date Year"` (e.g., "Mon Mar 02 2026").
            🆔 Navigation: Find the `button` with name `"Next Month"` within the dialog to paginate.
        4️⃣. Occupancy Box:
            🔑 Keywords: guests, rooms, adults selector
            🆔 Identification: Look for a `button` whose name contains `"Guests and rooms"`.
        5️⃣. Search Button:
            🔑 Keywords: SEARCH button, submit
            🆔 Identification: Look for a `button` with the exact name `"SEARCH"`. (Usually located at the end of the `tabpanel`).
    🧩 PROMOTIONAL OVERLAYS (BLOCKERS):
        6️⃣. App Download Banner:
            🆔 Identification: Look for a `button` with the name `"Close"` inside a section containing `"Save 10% on your 1st app booking"`.
            👨‍🏫 Strategy: This banner often obscures the Search button. If "SEARCH" is not clickable, find this "Close" ref and click it first.
    🧩 SERVICE TABS:
        7️⃣. Tabs:
            🆔 Identification: `tab` role with names `"Hotels"`, `"Flights"`, `"Activities"`.
            🆔 Status Check: If the YAML shows `[selected]` on the tab, it is already active.

📚 FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES:
    🌐 Example 1: Select checkout date 4 days after current check-in date.
        📌 Scenario: "Select checkout date 4 days from current check-in".
        📌 Current State (from Snapshot): `- button "Check-in 26 Feb 2026 Thursday" [ref=e146]`
        📌 Agent Analyze and Actions:
            👉 Current check-in is Feb 26. 4 days later is March 2, 2026.
            👉 `playwright-cli click e146` (to open calendar).
        📌 New State (from Snapshot): `- button "Mon Mar 02 2026 Price is 3,092K VND" [ref=e1521]`
        📌 Agent Analyze and Actions:
            👉 `playwright-cli click e1521`
    🌐 Example 2: Selecting a destination from the autocomplete list.
        📌 Scenario: "Search for hotels in Hong Kong".
        📌 Current State (from Snapshot): `- combobox "Enter a destination..." [ref=e144]`
        📌 Agent Thinks or Actions:
            👉 `playwright-cli fill e144 "Hong Kong"`
        📌 New State (from Snapshot): `- generic [ref=e180] [cursor=pointer]: Hong Kong, Hong Kong`
        📌 Agent Analyze and Actions:
            👉 `playwright-cli click e180`
    🌐 Example 3: Clear the App Promo blocker
        📌 Scenario: The "SEARCH" button is obscured by an app download banner.
        📌 Agent Analyze and Actions:
            👉 Find Close ref: `button "Close" [ref=e593]` (inside section `e591`)
            👉 Action: `playwright-cli click e593`
            👉 Refresh state: `playwright-cli snapshot`
            👉 Proceed to click `button "SEARCH"` with its new ref.
    🌐 Example 4: Correct Input Handling (Avoid "too many arguments" error)
        📌 Scenario: Enter "New York" into the destination search bar.
        📌 Agent Analyze and Actions:
            👉 Identify Input: Found `combobox` with name "Enter a destination..." as `[ref=e145]`.
            👉 Selection Requirement: Must input text into this specific element.
            👉 Brainstorming: DO NOT use `playwright-cli type` please use `playwright-cli fill` to provide both the target ref and the text safely.
        📌 Agent Analyze and Actions:
            👉 `playwright-cli fill e145 "New York"`
    🌐 Example 5: Search for Hotel Name with suggestion selection
        📌 Scenario: Search for "Park Hyatt Saigon".
        📌 Agent Analyze and Actions:
            👉 Identify Input: `combobox` name "Enter a destination..." is `[ref=e144]`.
            👉 Action: `playwright-cli fill e144 "Park Hyatt Saigon"`
        📌 Next Step Brainstorming (Framework provides new snapshot):
            👉 Note "Selection Requirement": Must select the 1st suggestion from the list.
            👉 Identify Suggestion: Search for `generic` or `listitem` containing "Park Hyatt Saigon" with `[cursor=pointer]`.
            👉 Found: `[ref=e190]`.
            👉 Action: `playwright-cli click e190`
