🏠 HOMEPAGE WORKFLOW
===============
🚦 DECISION LOGIC:
🟢 Status: CONTINUE
    🕹️ Trigger: Standard sequential execution of the Search Form or Carousel interaction.
    🎬 Homepage Specific Conditions:
        📌 Search Input: The Auto-complete panel ([data-selenium="autocompletePanel"]) is visible after typing destination.
        📌 Date Picker: The Calendar container ([data-selenium="rangePickerCheckIn"]) is visible after clicking the Check-in box.
        📌 Occupancy: The Popover is visible after clicking the Occupancy box.
        📌 Carousels: The "Next" arrow is enabled, or the "Previous" arrow becomes visible after the first slide interaction.

🟠 Status: RETRY
    🕹️ Trigger: Handling UI Latency and "Click-Blocking" overlays.
    🎬 Homepage Specific Scenarios & Fixes:
        📌 Scenario: Click on "Search Button" failed because it was obscured by the Date Picker or Occupancy Popover.
            Fix: Dispatch a click to the page body or [data-element-name="search-box-layout"] to close the open popover, then retry the Search button click.
        📌 Scenario: Auto-complete suggestions ([data-testid="autosuggest-item"]) did not appear after typing.
            Fix: Clear the input (fill("")) -> Wait 500ms -> Re-type the keyword -> Wait for networkidle.
        📌 Scenario: Target Date is not visible in the current 2-month calendar view.
            Fix: Click [data-selenium="calendar-next-month-button"] -> Check visibility again. (Repeat up to 12 times).

🔵 Status: SKIP
    🕹️ Trigger: Default values match requirements or optional UI elements.
    🎬 Homepage Specific Scenarios:
        📌 Occupancy Defaults: If the test case requires "2 Adults" and the Occupancy Box text already reads "2 Adults", SKIP opening the Occupancy Popover.
        📌 Date Defaults: If the test case allows "Any Date" or "Today/Tomorrow", and the inputs are pre-filled, SKIP the Date Picker interaction.
        📌 Promotional Modals: If a "Coupons" or "Sign In" modal appears on load, SKIP normal flow to close it (.close-button) before proceeding.

🔴 Status: ABORT
    🕹️ Trigger: Critical Search Console failure.
    🎬 Homepage Specific Scenarios:
        📌 Broken Search: The "Search" button remains disabled (disabled attribute) even after all fields (Dest, Dates, Occupancy) are validly filled.
        📌 No Suggestions: The API returns no results for a known valid city (e.g., "Hong Kong") after 3 retries (indicates API down).
        📌 Calendar Freeze: The Date Picker does not open when clicking the Check-in box.
===============
🎯 TEST COMPLETION SIGNALS:
✅ Test Case Status: COMPLETE (PASS)
    🎖️ Criteria: All actions listed in the Test Case Step Actions have been executed.
    ⚖️ Conditions:
        📌 Step Exhaustion: The LLM has iterated through the final step of the provided list (e.g., Step 6 of 6 is done).
        📌 No Blockers: The workflow did not encounter an ABORT condition.
        📌 Note: Even if the visual result is wrong (e.g., Search Page didn't load), if the LLM successfully performed the "Click Search" action without a generic crash, the status is COMPLETE. Validation is delegated to the Observer.
        
❌ Test Case Status: FAILURE (FAIL)
    🎖️ Criteria: The execution flow was interrupted and could not finish the list.
    ⚖️ Conditions:
        📌 Abort Triggered: The workflow logic returned ABORT (see Section 1).
        📌 Stuck: The LLM cannot perform the required action for the current step (e.g., cannot find the "Search" button), preventing it from reaching the end of the test steps.
