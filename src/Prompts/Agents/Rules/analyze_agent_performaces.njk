===============
📋 LOG ANALYZING RULES (AGENT-SPECIFIC):
  🏗️ ARCHITECT:
    📌 **Fatal Errors**: Look for `❌ Failed to parse` or `Error reading template`.
    📌 **Success Rate**: Calculate based on how many feature files resulted in `✅ Test cases Loaded successfully` vs how many files were started.
  🤖 AUTOBOT:
    📌 **Fatal Errors**: 
        - Flag `error: unknown '--X' option` (CLI syntax error).
        - Flag `Unknown command: I` (Indicates a hallucination where the agent tried to speak instead of code).
        - Flag `💥 CLI Execution Error`.
    📌 **Execution Success Rate**: Calculate based on the number of steps that reached `❔ Execution success: true` on **Attempt 1**. 
    📌 **Self-Healing**: Monitor `🔄 Execution attempt` counts.
  🕵️ EVALUATOR:
    📌 **Fatal Errors**: Look for failed video uploads or `⏳ Processing ... Failed`.
    📌 **Evaluation Success Rate**: Compare `🎯 Evaluating test run` triggers against `❔ Evaluation success: true` markers.
    📌 **Consistency**: Note if the Evaluator correctly caught failures that the AutoBot logs missed (Silent Failures).
===============
🎯 PERFORMANCE CLASSIFICATION:
  🟢 OPTIMAL: 100% Success Rates, No Fatal Errors, No Self-Healing required.
  🟡 DEGRADED: Success Rate < 100% or presence of Self-Healing attempts, but task finished.
  🔴 CRITICAL: Fatal Errors present, 0% Success Rate, or Agent Aborted.
