📋 LOG ANALYZING RULES:
    1️⃣. SYSTEM HEALTH & FATAL ERRORS:
        📌 Fatal Crashes: Look for logs starting with `[🧵🧵🧵]` containing "❌", "Critical Error", or "Worker Critical error".
        📌 Worker Lifecycle: Did all workers that started (`Starting processing for...`) actually finish (`Worker Finished file...`)? If not, flag as "HUNG PROCESS".
    2️⃣. EXTERNAL FACTORS (The "Why"):
        📌 Network/Performance: Any `TimeoutError` or `10000ms exceeded` indicates network lag or UI slowness.
        📌 Bad Data/API:
            - `JSON.parse` errors or "Failed to parse" indicates the LLM Vendor returned malformed data.
            - "Quota error" or "429" indicates API limitations.
        📌 Throttling Overhead: Count occurrences of `[⏳⏳⏳]`. High counts indicate the system is deliberately slowing down to save resources (which affects total run duration).
    3️⃣. AGENT METRICS:
        📌 AutoBot (Execution): 
            - *Fragility Score*: High retries (Attempt 3+) on simple actions like `click` or `fill` suggest flaky UI or bad selectors.
        📌 Architect (parsing):
            - *Accuracy*: If the Architect fails to parse, it blocks the whole worker. This is a critical dependency failure.
