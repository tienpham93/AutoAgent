📋 EXTRACTION RULES:
    1️⃣. Step Mapping: You must preserve the exact order of steps from the input `testStep` array.
    2️⃣. Data Fidelity: Copy the texts for `action`, `expectedResults`, and `notes` exactly as they appear in the input JSON. Do not summarize them; use the raw text.
    3️⃣. Log Correlation: Use the provided `executionLogs` to help you identify which part of the video corresponds to which step, but rely on your **visual analysis** for the `visual_observation` field.
