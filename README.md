# 🤖 Agentic Automation Framework

An agentic automation framework powered by **LangChain**, **LangGraph**, and **Playwright**. This project utilizes four specialized LLM Agents to transform natural language test cases into executed actions, recorded artifacts, verified results, and system health audits.

## 🔄 The 4-Agent Workflow

1.  **🧠 Architect Agent**:
    *   **Action**: Analyzes raw test basis (Markdown/Feature files), maps proper `playwright-cli` skills and page knowledges, and extracts them into a structured execution plan.
    *   **Output**: Produces `extracted_all_testcase.json`.

2.  **🤖 AutoBot Agent**:
    *   **Action**: Consumes the JSON plan, spawns a browser via `playwright-cli`, interprets the **Elements Tree**, and executes steps while handling dynamic UI changes and self-healing.
    *   **Output**: Execution artifacts: `video.webm`, snapshots, and `execution_logs.json`.

3.  **🕵️ Evaluator Agent**:
    *   **Action**: Uploads the execution video to Google Gemini (Multimodal), watches the playback, and compares visual evidence against the test requirements.
    *   **Output**: Generates `evaluations.json`.

4.  **👮 Inspector Agent**:
    *   **Action**: Scans all terminal logs (`full_*.log`). It acts as an SRE to detect syntax errors, LLM hallucinations, and infrastructure lag.
    *   **Output**: Generates `log_inspections.json` (The System Audit).

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone git@github.com:tien-pham/AutoAgent.git

# Install dependencies
bun install

# Install Playwright browsers and CLI tools
bunx playwright install
```

### 🏃 Execution Commands

The framework is designed to run in a specific pipeline. You can run individual stages or the full End-to-End flow.

| Command | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `bun run test:extract` | Run extraction.ts to parses Markdown feature files into `extracted_all_testcase.json`. |
| `bun run test:run` | Triggers the **Runner** to execute test cases in parallel (configurable workers). |
| `bun run test:eval` | Run evaluation.ts that sends execution videos to Gemini for visual verification. |
| `bun run test:inspect` | Audits the `full_*.log` files for agent performance errors. |
| `bun run test:allure` | Compiles all JSON results into a searchable Allure Report. |
| **`bun run test:e2e`** | **Runs the full pipeline (Extract -> Run -> Eval -> Inspect -> Allure).** |
| `bun run test:cleanup` | Removes the `output/` folder and old artifacts. |

## 🔬 Way of Working: Manual Debugging with `playwright-cli`

When a test step fails or you are building a new **Page Context**, you should use the manual debugging workflow. This allows you to verify exactly how the `playwright-cli` interacts with the site before committing logic to an AI Agent.

### 1. Manual Exploration
Launch a manual CLI session to test selectors and commands:
```bash
# Open the browser
bun run pwcli open https://www.agoda.com

# Take a snapshot to see the YAML element tree (and get [ref=eXXX] IDs)
bun run pwcli snapshot

# Test an interaction using a ref found in the snapshot
bun run pwcli click e144
bun run pwcli fill e144 "Hong Kong"
```

### 2. Building Page Knowledges (.njk)
If the manual `click` or `fill` works, use that structural information to update your templates:
1.  **Contexts** (`Prompts/Pages/Contexts/`): Define component names and mapping logic using the stable ARIA names/roles found in your manual `snapshot`.
2.  **Workflows** (`Prompts/Pages/Workflows/`): Define "Decision Logic" (when to RETRY, when to SKIP) based on the visual behavior you observed during manual testing.

### 3. Rapid Bootstrapping
You don't need to write `.njk` files from scratch:
*   Run `bun run pwcli snapshot --filename=temp.yml`.
*   Copy the content of `temp.yml` and a similar existing `.njk` file.
*   Ask Gemini/ChatGPT: *"Using the provided YAML structure, generate a new Page Context template following this NJK format."*
